3/11/2014

Foundation for building SDL 2.0 applications and games.

Build requirements
 - SDL 2.0 (http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

Notes:
 - You probably want to use and build against 32-bit build of SDL
 - These project files assume SDL is located inside of "SDL2" folder and part of your search paths (SDL2/SDL.h)
 - Build files using a compatible c++11 compiler
